# Maze 4.2

## 4.2.1 & 4.2.2
See the comments in our code.
We implemented the generic search algorithm by an Abstract class: BasicSearch.
BFS and DFS only have to specify how the frontier is implemented.

## 4.2.3

We can see a few differences between the DFS and the BFS, the BFS finds the shortest path while the DFS just finds a path. The Maze is designed so that it finds the only other path there is.
In our output for DFS the 14 paths added correspond to the steps of the path, whereas in the BFS we have actually 18 which is way more then the 10 steps we took. If there where more paths we would moreover see that DFS has linear and BFS has exponential cost.
In our portal example in 4.2.5 we see that the path found by DFS may be much longer than the shortest one and the number of paths added to the frontier may be larger than with BFS, even though the number of paths checked is smaller.
A lot depends on cycle detection and multiple path pruning settings. (see our Implementation of BasicSearch for details.

### <----- :output end ----->
We use cycle detection (which can be turned off in our implementation) and have finite graphs 
which means that the only way we wont find a solution is that there is no solution. Of course, 
even though we optionally use multiple path pruning some labyrinths may be too large to find a 
solution in suitable time.

## 4.2.5

We implemented Portals with a Map: Point -> Point. We add both tuples to ensure, that the portal
works in both directions. Before we generate a successor state we check whether it's a state in 
which the robot is on a portal. If so, we generate the corresponding state in which the robot is 
on the other end of the portal instead, ie. the robot is teleported immediately. For implementation details see our code.
